                                                    Some of the banks and Credit/Debit Card companies put cap on the no. of transactions (normally three transactions) one can make for a single entity in a single day. Due to this restriction, the subsequent transaction effort fails. However, you can make payment the next day or on the same day using the different Credit/Debit Card or Net Banking Facility.
